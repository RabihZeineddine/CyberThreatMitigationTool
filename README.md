# Cyber Threat Detection & Mitigation Tool ðŸš€

A **Python-based cybersecurity tool** designed to **monitor, analyze, and detect network anomalies** in real-time. This tool leverages **machine learning (Isolation Forest)** and **packet sniffing (Scapy)** to identify suspicious network activity and enhance security operations.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
âœ… **Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring**  
âœ… **Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection**  
âœ… **Automated Security Alerts & Logging**  
âœ… **Packet Analysis with Scapy**  
âœ… **Lightweight & Efficient for Cybersecurity Applications**

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works
1. Captures live network traffic using **Scapy**.
2. Extracts key features (packet size, protocol, source/destination ports, TTL).
3. Uses **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies in network behavior.
4. Logs security events and triggers alerts if suspicious activity is found.
